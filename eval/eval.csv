Initial studies have suggested that inflammatory markers may have a role in predicting severity. We investigated whether admission and day 4 CRP could predict severity in community-acquired pneumonia.',
       'A prospective study was carried out over a 2-year period in a large teaching hospital. CRP was measured on admission and on day 4. The outcomes of interest were: 30-day mortality; need for mechanical ventilation and/or inotropic support; development of complicated pneumonia (lung abscess, empyema, or complicated parapneumonic effusion); the value of predictive tests were assessed using multivariate logistic regression.',
